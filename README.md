# C-Study
Most of these projects were developed in C instead of C++ for a better understanding of the language, but most codes could be simplified with minor changes, such as adding 
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std
to the beggining of the .c files (that would have to be changed to .cpp), and then being able to use type string, which would allow the following changes:
printf() to cout <<
scanf() to cin >> 
strcpy() to =
strcat() to +=
